## spring-security-app

### Web application demonstrating the possibilities of authentication and authorization of Spring Security Technology

***Description:***

This example shows how Spring Security intercepts all user requests and transfers them to the authentication page. 
By default, all newly registered users are assigned the ROLE_USER. 
Only the pre-installed website Administrator has ROLE_ADMIN and can access a particular page 
that ordinary users cannot access.

***How to use:***

Create a new local "database" schema (I used MySQL), 
and add your username and password to the application.properties file. <br/>
Create the "SecurityApplication" class run configuration in your IDE and start the Spring Security Application. 
Link to resource: 
http://localhost:8080 <br/>
You will be taken to the authentication page. 
Register a new user or use the preset credentials: <br/>
Username: user <br/>
Password: test <br/>
or <br/>
Username: admin <br/>
Password: test <br/>
Admin has access to a particular webpage:
http://localhost:8080/admin

***Tools used:***

Java <br/>
Maven <br/>
Spring Boot <br/>
Spring Security <br/>
Thymeleaf <br/>
MySQL <br/>
FlyWay <br/>
